        <p><a href="http://delta-institute.org">Delta Institute</a> is a nonprofit working to build a resilient Great Lakes environment and economy through sustainable solutions. One of Delta's <a href="http://delta-institute.org/objectives/">strategic objectives</a> is to <em>disrupt the energy status quo</em> by helping buildings become more efficient, creating strategies to increase renewable energy generation, and, in the case of DeltaLumin, working directly with consumers to understand how they use and manage their energy and develop effective strategies for behavior change.</p>

        <p>Delta has ten years of experience working directly with homeowners on energy conservation. For years, we implemented a home weatherization program to educate homeowners on where their homes were energy inefficient and guide them toward solutions. For DeltaLumin, we wanted to flip our top-down program approach and instead start with the energy users.</p>

        <p>With funding from the Illinois Science & Energy Innovation Foundation (<a href="http://www.iseif.org/">ISEIF</a>), we set out to apply the principles of human-centered design to inform the creation and piloting of a product or service that, based on an understanding of individual users, would leverage insights from smart meter data to help consumers make smarter energy decisions. We initiated a partnership with renowned design firm <a href="http://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, whose expertise in human-centered design informed our on-the-ground research and the design of great product concepts. Because smart meter program uptake lagged in low-income, senior and "<a href="http://www.iseif.org/apply/faq/">hard-to-reach</a>" communities, we focused our outreach to those communities.  To help us connect with those communities, we brought on one of our long-time partners, <a href="http://www.faithinplace.org/">Faith in Place</a>, who led community outreach and recruitment efforts.</p>

	<h2>The Delta Lumin Approach</h2>
</div>

<div class="sectionIntro">
	<p>Delta worked with our partners to develop a user-focused, empathetic approach to product and program design. We began by spending time with our potential users, getting to know their relationship with energy use, technology, and preferred methods of communications. Those experiences directly informed the development of the DeltaLumin product and service.</p>

    <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
		<p><blockquote class="sideQuote">"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam dignissim accumsan tempor. Nam pellentesque justo quam, quis malesuada libero semper ut. Duis laoreet augue elit, eleifend posuere sapien varius eu." <strong>--Tim Brown, CEO IDEO</strong>
</blockquote></p>

<p>Delta worked with design firm <a href="http://ideo.com">IDEO</a> to take a human-centered design approach to the development and piloting of the DeltaLumin product and service. Human-centered design is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of the needs, values, and motivations of the potential users of the product or service being designed. The process often begins with intensive field research that results in specific insights that are then combined with design strategies to develop new products or services that meet the needs of the people who use them.</p>

<p>The initial research efforts in the DeltaLumin approach were led by IDEO and included in-home interviews with potential users and later small group discussions around different possibilities for communicating personalized energy use information enabled by smart meter technology. Some insights that surfaced as a result included:</p>

<ul> 
	<li>People want to see their information put in their context.</li>
	<li>People want to have flexibility when paying their utility bills.</li>
	<li>People want to identify problem areas and set goals to fix them.</li>
	<li>People want to be able to give back to their communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Themes of human-centered design continued throughout the pilot in the implementation of monthly workshops and the iteration of the energy model used to provide energy updates and the visual language used to communicate with pilot participants. </p>

    <h3>Indicators of Engagement</h3>
		<p>A human-centered design approach inherently accepts that there are many different and valid ways in which customers may value and use energy, and a design process that empathizes with their value systems will be more effective in providing overall benefit. </p>

<p>Results of the pilot were evaluated using a mixed methods approach, which involves employing both qualitative and quantitative strategies of inquiry (e.g. numeric information like energy use data collected concurrently to text information through open-ended survey questions). This approach was used because the indicators of successful engagement include both changes in measurable energy use and changes in non-numeric opinions, motivations, and intentions related to energy use. Indicators of participant engagement included:</p>

	<h2>Finding Our Participants</h2>
</div>

<div class="sectionIntro">
	<p>Faith in Place led recruitment efforts for the project with support from Delta. Recruitment involved initial research on the geography of smart meter rollout in addition to many hours on the ground talking with potential participants.</p>

<div class="section-content">
    <h3>Demographic and Geographic Priorities</h3>
		<p>Delta focused on identifying pilot participants that had smart meters in their homes and fit with ISEIF’s priority demographic characteristics, including low-income households and seniors. Delta conducted research to identify the geographic areas throughout Chicago where smart meters had already been installed and that were largely low-income communities. Faith in Place led the on-the-ground recruitment efforts focusing their attention on places of worship in the areas of high priority. </p>

    <h3>Recruitment Team</h3>
		<p>The Faith in Place recruitment team visited XX places of worship throughout the recruitment period. Faith in Place was crucial in developing and communicating the value of the program to potential participants, administering eligibility surveys, and sustaining engagement through the enrollment process and beyond. </p>

    <h3>Final Pilot Cohort</h3>
		<p>The final pilot cohort consisted of a diverse group of 75 south and west side Chicago residents from XX different community areas. Though the age of participants varied, the majority were over 50 years old with XX over 65 years old. Most participating households were single- or two-person households, as many were retirees or parents with grown children. [income] 71% of participating households owned rather than rented their homes, and most homes were between [home size].</p>
<p>At the pilot kick-off event, participants completed a baseline survey for the DeltaLumin program. This survey collected information related to their homes, appliances, interaction with ComEd, as well as actions they had taken to save energy in the past. Questions were asked both about energy-saving behaviors and any energy-efficient home appliances they have. This helped us to understand the potential for reducing total energy consumption through behavior change and home retrofits. </p>

	<h2>Building a Prototype</h2>
</div>

<div class="sectionIntro">
	<p>The DeltaLumin team built a prototype web dashboard and communication service to test the energy illumination strategies developed in the earlier stages of the project. Developing the prototype involved building quick, low-fidelity versions of products and services we hypothesized would have an impact on our participants’ relationship with energy use. The next section will outline how the prototype was tested with users.</p>

<p>Due to constraints in accessing individual smart meter data, we developed an energy model that estimated energy use data that we could then present visually to our participants.</p>

<p>To work around the constraints related to smart meter data availability, the DeltaLumin team collected information on: (1) current weather patterns during the pilot period, (2) individual energy use data for each participant going back two years, and (3) the current appliances in their home including date and models. This information was used to simulate personalized energy updates in several forms. Based on our research, we determined that the most important data to present to our participants included:</p>

<ul>
	<li>breaking down energy use by energy-consuming appliances and devices,</li> 
	<li>breaking down energy use across time,</li>
	<li>measuring progress towards typical energy use for the month, and </li>
	<li>alignment with existing utility programs.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Visualizing Energy Use</h3>
		<p>Several themes in the visual design of energy use information emerged through our early conversations with our targeted audience. One consistent finding was that participants found it much easier to understand their energy use when it was presented in dollars rather than in units of energy (kilowatt-hours or kwH). We also found that keeping information simple and clear was most effective in promoting understanding. These findings informed the design of our dashboard below.</p>

<p>Google Sheets provided a valuable development back end as we tweaked our energy models. The data was served to the front end, and scalable vector graphics (SVGs) were created on an as-needed basis using the JavaScript library D3.js.</p>

<div class="section-content">
    <h3>Communicating Energy Use</h3>
		<p>After calculating the data and using that data to build visualizations, we then built a system for communicating that information to participants through channels that were easily accessible for them, including the online participant dashboard, emails, and printed letters.</p>

		<p>Connecting the data to the online dashboard was accomplished using Google Sheets and Tabletop, a javascript library that converts Google Sheets data to objects and/or arrays through an XHR. This was useful for modifying and tweaking calculations, but it is too slow for a production environment. The back end will be rebuilt to allow for more real-time data manipulation.</p>
		
		<p>Developing individualized email and print mailings required the creation of a PNG factory using saveSVGAsPNG. This allowed the team to use the Dashboard instead of replicating this functionality in Adobe Creative Suite. The team used Salesforce to insert PNGs for email.</p>

<div class="section-content">
    <h3>Refining the Model</h3>
		<p>The pilot provided valuable information about the limitations of monthly data in giving users useful energy information, even when the data is well-modeled. Users need at least day-after data to make any action or decisions on purchases. The availability of this data is also important. Though our development product is able to take monthly data and work through algorithms to process it into passable daily data, a daily feed is much more likely to return accurate data and recommendations.</p>

<div class="sectionIntro">
	<p>The DeltaLumin pilot ran for three months and included an onboarding process with an enrollment packet and kick-off events, twice-monthly energy updates communicating personal energy use, monthly workshops to solicitdirect feedback from participants through conversation and written surveys, and continued engagement and participant support.</p>

	<div class="col-sm-8">
		<p>In the enrollment process, we sent eligible participants their enrollment packet, which outlined the pilot objectives and schedule and asked them to: (1) attend a kick-off event, (2) collect information about their appliances, and (3) agree to share their utility information with DeltaLumin. At the pilot kick-off events, participants received more information,  completed baseline surveys, completed additional paperwork, and participated in their first energy-related activity.</p>

    <h3>Workshop Series</h3>
		<p>Throughout the DeltaLumin Pilot Program there were five in-person events including two kick-off events and three pilot participant workshops. The purpose of these events was to gain insight into the participants’ reactions to the forms in which DeltaLumin communicates their energy use data. This was accomplished through open-ended discussion, written surveys, and facilitated activities.</p>

		<h4>Pilot Kick-Off Event: Introduction to the Program</h4>
		<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a baseline for both participants’ personal energy use and their understanding of energy. </p>
		<p><strong>Exercise:</strong> In anticipation of the first Energy Update, which would include an Appliance Spending Diagnosis outlining estimated energy use per appliance, the Kick-Off activity aimed to better understand how participants currently think about the energy consumption of individual appliances.</p>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>
</div>

<div class="sectionIntro">
	<p>The first year of DeltaLumin provided a number of features that allowed users to better understand their energy use. In year 1, we also reviewed two other features, Flexible Payments and Giving Back, that give users reasons other than being provoked with their energy use information to be motivated to save energy. Year 2 will focus on building out a payment platform that can allow flexible payments and refining our year 1 feature set. We are also going to be building out our onboarding program to meet the needs of low-income customers’ unique circumstances.</p>
